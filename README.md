# PLEASE DONT SKIP THE README!!!

nii-nvim is a very minimal nvim dotfiles focused on creating a functional editor with a minmal amount of plugins. nii-nvim also has the user in mind by being very extensible and documented.
#### **NOTE**: nii-nvim is currently under development, meaning that many things may not work as intended, or may not be implemented at all.

## Why nii-nvim?
Many of the neovim configurations that exist (i.e. NvChad, Spacevim, etc.) are either heavily bloated, difficult to extend, or tailored to a specific task/workflows. nii-nvim aims to solve this by providing the end user with a base configuration that contains everything needed for a very basic editor with all of the base components in place, so that the end user can create there own workflow from that base. nii-nvim contains a bunch of features including lsp integration, snippets (planned), autocomplete, and themes.

The end goal of nii-nvim is to be use as a base config for users to extend and add upon, leading to a more unique editing experience.
Also the name is cute, and sounds small. 	(・3・)

## Requirements
* `neovim 5.0 or greater`
* `fzf`
* `git`
* `A Nerd Font` for tree and tab icon support

## Features
* Fully documented config, designed to be understandable by both inexperienced and experienced (Work in progress)
* Sane Defaults for ease of mind ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
* Popular coloschemes pre-packaged with lualine integration including:
  * One Dark
  * Nord
  * Gruvbox
  * Monokai
  * and a few others!!
* Easily Extensible configuration
* Swag 	(̿▀̿ ̿Ĺ̯̿̿▀̿ ̿)̄
